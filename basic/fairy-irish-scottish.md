The intricate world of fairies has deep roots in both Irish and Scottish folklore, reflecting the intertwined histories and shared cultural influences of these regions. At their core, fairies were believed to be the Tuatha Dé Danann, the children or people of the goddess Danu. According to the mythological history of Ireland, as detailed in the Book of Invasions, the Tuatha Dé Danann were penultimate invaders of the island. However, they were eventually defeated by the final invaders, the Sons of Míl or Milesians, in the great battle of Tailtiu.

After their defeat, the Tuatha Dé Danann were not evicted from Ireland. Instead, an unusual agreement ensured their continued presence in the country. The Milesians would rule the surface, while the Tuatha Dé Danann claimed the underside of the world. Thus, the Tuatha Dé Danann transitioned into the fairy folk, dwelling within the hills, under the bogs, and in other liminal areas of Ireland. This transformation aligns with a Christian narrative of the fallen angels, casting the fairies as divinities who had lost their heavenly status.

The myth of the banishment of these ancient beings to fairyland somewhat contradicts the actual fairy lore, which primarily thrived in oral tradition until collected by folklorists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some divinities, such as Clídna, Macha, and Midir, feature in fairy tales, while others like the Dagda and Brigit do not. It remains speculative if tales ever existed that narrated these divine beings' lives beneath local hills.

Fearful of their power, the humans rarely referred to these beings as fairies or Tuatha Dé Danann. Instead, they used euphemistic Irish phrases like Daoine Maithe (the Good People), Áes Sídhe (People of the Fairy Mounds), and Daoine Uaisle (the Gentry). Other names, such as the Wee Folk, the Hill Crowd, the Red Caps, and the Host of the Air, were also used to refer to these otherworldly inhabitants.

The language surrounding fairies in Modern Irish is often rooted in the term 'sí' or 'sídh,' meaning 'fairy mound.' However, the aes síde, or 'people of the fairy mounds,' of old are not quite identical to the fairies of later Irish tradition. While these entities are generally equatable, the aes síde were portrayed in a more nuanced way in early literature.

The fairy tradition is extensive in modern Ireland. Thomas Crofton Croker was among the earliest to collect and print fairy lore, and his works had a profound impact on global literature, including inspiring the Grimm brothers. The popularization of Irish fairy traditions was also significantly influenced by W.B. Yeats, who was an avowed believer in fairies and frequently integrated fairy traditions into his literary works.

The fairy tradition in Scotland also exhibits striking similarities to that of Ireland. The queen of the fairies in Scotland was often known as Neven or NicNeven, a name derived from Neamhain, an Old Irish war-goddess. Just like in Irish folklore, fairies and supernatural afflictions in Scotland could be warded off with iron, a pierced stone, holly, or rowan. The Scots-language ballads of 'Thomas Rymer' and 'Tam Lin' tell the tales of journeys to and from the Otherworld, showing Celtic influence with the importance of Hallowe'en. Elfland, where Thomas Rymer was taken, is described in opulent terms, reminiscent of the Irish otherworld.

Thus, the tradition of fairies in Irish and Scottish folklore intertwines divinity, defeat, banishment, and transformation. It represents a rich blend of history, mythology, and popular belief, showcasing the enduring power of folklore in shaping cultural narratives.
