        * Fairy (Irish & Scottish)
          1. Fairies, or the Tuatha Dé Danann, hold significant places in both Irish and Scottish folklore due to their intertwined cultural histories.
          2. Based on the Book of Invasions, the Tuatha Dé Danann, as ancient invaders, were eventually defeated by the Sons of Míl or Milesians in the great battle of Tailtiu.
          3. Following their defeat, the Tuatha Dé Danann, instead of being evicted, were given the underside of the world to inhabit while the Milesians claimed the surface, leading to their transformation into fairies.
          4. The narrative of their banishment contrasts with actual fairy lore that was largely passed down orally until it was documented in the 19th and 20th centuries, and it's speculative whether tales narrated these divine beings living beneath the hills.
          5. Out of fear for their power, humans referred to these beings with euphemistic terms instead of calling them fairies or Tuatha Dé Danann.
          6. Modern Irish language referring to fairies is often rooted in 'sí' or 'sídh,' meaning 'fairy mound,' though the aes síde of old literature are not quite the same as the fairies of later Irish tradition.
          7. The fairy tradition is extensive in modern Ireland, and the works of Thomas Crofton Croker and W.B. Yeats significantly influenced the popularization of Irish fairy traditions.
          8. Scottish fairy tradition, much like its Irish counterpart, has a queen of the fairies, known as Neven or NicNeven, and shares practices to ward off fairies and supernatural afflictions.
          9. The ballads 'Thomas Rymer' and 'Tam Lin' in Scots-language depict journeys to and from the Otherworld, showing Celtic influence, while Elfland, where Thomas Rymer was taken, is described opulently, similar to the Irish otherworld.
          10. Fairy tradition in Irish and Scottish folklore, blending divinity, defeat, banishment, and transformation, underscores the enduring influence of folklore in shaping cultural narratives.
        * Fairy (Manx)
          1. Describe the character of the fynnoderee, a fairy from the Isle of Man folklore, its appearance, how it behaves, and its significance in the Manx version of the Bible, particularly in the context of Isaiah 34:14.
          2. Discuss the other types of fairies in the Isle of Man folklore, specifically the buggane and the glashtyn, their characteristics, and any comparisons with other mythological beings.
          3. Explain the connection between the Manx fairies and local artifacts of significance, as recorded by A. W. Moore in his book "Folk-lore of the Isle of Man". Provide a detailed account of the story where a young man encounters fairies and is left with a cup, and what happens to this cup later.

          2. Discuss the habits of the Tylwyth Teg, their interactions with humans, and Hugh Evans's theory about their possible smoking habits. Also, elaborate on the significance of the name given to a small clay object, cetyn y Tylwyth Teg.
          3. Explore the other mythical creatures found in Welsh folklore, such as the pwca, gßyll, and ellyll, and how they're referenced in the work of 14th-century poet Dafydd ap Gwilym. Discuss the potential interpretations of the term "ellyll" in the context of Welsh triads.
          4. Discuss how various terms related to fairies are used in the Welsh language, such as tân ellyllon, bwyd ellyllon, and menig ellyllon, and what these terms mean.
        * Fairy (Breton)
          1. Discuss the strong link between supernatural entities and the deceased in the region of Brittany, or Breizh, with many of these beings being part of the Anaon, the collective of departed souls. Describe the concept of revenants in this context and their forms of penance, as well as the belief in souls returning as animals and the interpretation of standing stones.
          2. Describe other mythical beings in Breton folklore, such as the korrigan, mermaids known as morwreg, and more sinister figures like mari-morganed or morganed. Discuss their characteristics, actions, and a narrative collected by F.-M. Luzel from the island of Ushant that involves the morganed.
          3. Explain the traditional practices in Brittany to protect oneself from the malevolent poulpikanned, including keeping a vessel filled with grains, sticking a folding knife into the ground near the fire, and hanging a string of eggshells in stables.

          3. Discuss the tale of 'The Fairy Widower' as documented by both Hunt and Bottrell. Outline the story's plot, which involves a young woman agreeing to care for a fairy's child and her subsequent unhappiness after being sent back from fairyland.

        * Fairyland
          1. Describe the complexities and different interpretations of the term 'Otherworld' within the context of Celtic beliefs and mythology. Discuss how this term should be used with caution and as a general label for 'supernatural place(s)', distinct from Christian tradition.
          2. Delve into the historical understanding of the 'Otherworld' from Roman and Byzantine sources, including the idea of the soul's post-mortem journey and the possible location of the Otherworld on islands. Compare this with Brythonic traditions and non-Celtic myths. Discuss the challenge of using archaeological evidence to support beliefs in the supernatural.
          3. Explore the concept of 'Otherworld' within Gaelic tradition and early Irish sources. Explain the term síd and its various interpretations, focusing on the debate over its meaning and the correlation with man-made mounds in Ireland and north-west Europe.

      14. Discuss Irving Hallowell's research among the Ojibwa in Canada during the 1930s, his subsequent paper written in the 1960s, and how this research reveals the Ojibwa's unique understanding of personhood, extending it to non-human entities.
      15. Elaborate on the stark contrast between the Ojibwa's concept of personhood and the modernist perspective that reserves personhood exclusively for humans, thereby creating a definitive split between human and non-human.
      16. Explain the term 'other-than-human persons' introduced by Hallowell as understood and appreciated by Bird-David, and how this perspective challenges modernist biases.
      17. Reflect on Strathern's comparison between Asian Melanesian and Euro-American concepts of personhood in 1988. Describe her argument that the indivisibility of the individual is a particularly modernist concept and is not universally applicable.
      18. Describe the Melanesian perception of a person being a sum of their relationships, and how this concept mirrors their societal network.
      19. Discuss Strathern's agreement with Dumont that each person, as per Indian thought, is a composite of transferable particles forming their personal substance.
      20. Illustrate the communal living situation of the Nayaka and how it influences their shared experiences and perception of personhood.
      21. Highlight the difference in response to tragedy in Western and indigenous societies, focusing on the Nayaka's practice of sharing and their taboos against refusal.

       8. "How does the dividual concept challenge the Western dichotomy of individual versus collective?"

       10. "What transformative insights into personhood does the dividual concept offer, as seen in the works of Strathern and Bird-David?"
    3. Lesson 3: The Nature of Spirits in Animism
       1.  "Describe the concept of Devaru or spirits in animistic cultures, emphasizing their presence in both village settings and the broader world. Highlight the interpretation of the world as a mixture of changing and unchanging entities, with the latter transforming at a slower rate."
       2. "Discuss the perception of world events in animistic cultures, noting the importance of understanding entities not only for their inherent attributes but also for what they offer to the observer. Relate this to the Nayaka culture's focus on events and their unique connection with their environment and psyche."
       3. "Explain how the Nayaka detect spirits or 'devaru' through unusual or noticeable changes in their interconnected world. Provide examples such as a Nayakan woman bringing a stone that 'approached' her into her village, or a stone that 'leapt into a man's relative's lap' being considered a devaru."
       4. "Explain how spirits are recognized by their agency and how the acknowledgement of spirits depends on the observer's perception of the event. Use the example of the man who identified an elephant spirit from regular elephants because it looked him directly in the eye."
       5. "Discuss how spirits are invoked and engaged in casual conversations during performances in Nayaka culture, with the spirits often being questioned about causing disasters as a result of taboo violations. Mention how the success of these performances is judged based on the quality of representation."
       6. "Discuss the loss of alternative ways of knowing in Western societies, as highlighted by Tim Ingold and Brian Morris, and how Bird-David responds to these observations by noting that traits of hunter-gatherers can be found in other societal forms."
       7.  "Discuss the perspective that maintains a fundamental dichotomy between Self and Other, without labeling the Other as 'Them' or 'Not-Us'. Refer to Sinéad Garrigan Mattar's argument about redefining animism in terms of human-environment relations and how this resonates with Yeats's fairy lore."
       8.  "Explain how Yeats's belief about Irish nature being more than just the 'sad soliloquies' of the British Empire echoes in Bird-David's studies. Discuss how the subject-object relationship of 19th-century science is replaced by subject-subject interactions in these narratives."
       9.  "Describe the intricate network of relations between the environment, humans, and a separate yet intrinsic spiritual realm, as embodied in Yeats's 'dividual' fairies. Highlight their role as part of a locally defined network of relations, operating within the context of social practices."
    4. Lesson 3: The Indo-European Spirit Double
       1.  The physical double, hamr, could leave the body during trances, sleep or through shapeshifting. These departures enabled interaction with spirits, visiting other realms and gaining knowledge. It could also take on animal forms indicative of the person's inner nature or destiny. Seeing one's hamr was considered an ominous death omen.
       2.  The psychic double, fylgja, served as a tutelary spirit, protecting and accompanying the person throughout their life. It was believed to reveal destiny and also to serve as a death omen when seen. Injuries to the fylgja were believed to cause harm to the person.
       3.  The hugr, or vital spirit, contained the person's life force, consciousness and will. It animated and connected the physical and psychic doubles to the world. In times of emotional distress, one's hugr could be called upon by simply thinking about them.
       4.  Reflections, shadows, and images were believed to contain aspects of the soul. They could be used in rituals to influence a person and causing harm to them was believed to affect the person.
       5.  Proper burial rites were important for the soul's journey after death, as they allowed the physical double to fully depart. If necessary, substitutes such as effigies were used.
       6.  Correspondences existed across different cultures regarding terms used for soul parts. However, local variations did occur over time. Similar beliefs in multiple doubles are observed in Finnish, Estonian, Vedic, and Lithuanian traditions.
       7.  Terms like the Roman 'genius' and Greek 'daimon' captured aspects of the pagan double. These functioned as guardian spirits and innate dispositions guiding a person.
       8.  Personhood was defined in a relational and pluralistic way, extending to non-human beings based on interactions and relationships, thereby challenging the modernist views of scholars like Tylor.
       9.  Accounts of shapeshifters, werewolves, witches, nightmares and other phenomena were interpreted differently based on cultural lenses. For pagans, these were considered natural abilities related to the physical double, while Christians often viewed them as demonic illusions.
